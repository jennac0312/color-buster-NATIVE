# COLOR BUSTER
    the brain game

How does your brain react when presented with conflicting information?
Can you ignore instinct in pursuit of a logical path? 
Step inside Color Buster to confront the limits of your own perception.

### How To Play
The concept of the game is the same across all modes: Resist your instinct.
In each mode, you are presented with a named color that is written in another color. This is the conflicting information.

Begin by selecting 1 of 4 modes. (easy, hard, speed, arcade)
Easy Mode is based on the Stroop Effect expirements. Your mission is to choose the color of the word.
Hard Mode is my interpretation of the Stroop Effect and loosely inspired by a TikTok color game. Your mission is to choose the color of the written word.
Speed Mode, allows 60 seconds to complete as many rounds as possible. (IN PROGRESS)
Arcade Mode tests how far a player can go without missing. (IN PROGRESS)
